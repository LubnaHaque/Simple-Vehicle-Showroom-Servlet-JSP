users can just add, remove, and see the vehicle list.
I have given the database within the vehicleDB folder.
-registration: username and password filter(if the length is less than 3), password hash(MD5).
-login
-add vehicle: you can add your vehicle by giving some info
-remove vehicle: remove vehicle by giving model number(if forget then you can see your list) 
-it shows only your vehicles.

(In the console, it shows-registration failed or success, login success or failed, removed vehicle, add vehicle, any exception message, etc)
